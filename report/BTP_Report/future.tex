This report so far discussed the methods for encryption-decryption based on non-linear chaotic map and utility in post-quantum cryptography.Through a number of simulations, we can conclude that this cryptosystem can provide the desired level of chaos and security. Moreover, this cryptosystem also fulfills the basic requirements defined by Shannon including diffusion and confusion.

Our next step would be generate a set of keys which can be employed for the purpose of encryption-decryption in practical scenarios. Although the implementation of basic hardware modules in FPGA are completed, various optimization of the algorithm is still in progress. We plan to measure the performance of the algorithm under various precision constraints and estimate the error rate. Further, we are required to perform necessary security analysis for the validation of this chaos-based cryptosystem.
